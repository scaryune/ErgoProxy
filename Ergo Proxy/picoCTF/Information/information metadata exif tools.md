**xifTool** is a [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software") program for reading, writing, and manipulating image, audio, video, and [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format "Portable Document Format") [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata"). It is [platform independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform#Platform-independent_software "Cross-platform"), available as both a [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl") library (Image::ExifTool) and [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface") application. ExifTool is commonly incorporated into different types of [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data "Digital data") [workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow "Workflow") and supports many types of metadata including [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif "Exif"), [IPTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPTC_Information_Interchange_Model "IPTC Information Interchange Model"), [XMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Metadata_Platform "Extensible Metadata Platform"), [JFIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFIF "JFIF"), [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF "GeoTIFF"), [ICC Profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Profile "ICC Profile"), Photoshop IRB, [FlashPix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlashPix "FlashPix"), AFCP and [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3 "ID3"), as well as the manufacturer-specific metadata formats of many [digital cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera "Digital camera").

## Metainformation encapsulation

ExifTool implements its own open [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") format. It is designed to encapsulate metainformation from many sources, in binary or textual form, and bundle it together with any type of file. It can either be a single file, wrapping existing data, or used as a [sidecar file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidecar_file "Sidecar file"), carrying for example [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif "Exif") or [XMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Metadata_Platform "Extensible Metadata Platform") metadata.
