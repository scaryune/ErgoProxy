# Operating System
## Components:
### Kernel:
The kernel of an OS communicates w/ the hardware ([cpu](/computers/cpu.md), [memory](/computers/memory.md))
### Applications
The other part of the operating system is the applications, which are based on and help run the kernel. *For example* [linux](/computers/linux.md) distros use the same kernel *but implement different applications*
