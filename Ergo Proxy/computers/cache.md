> Can you please describe how cahce works

> Certainly! Cache is like a super-fast shelf on your computer's desk. It's used to store things the computer is using very often, so it doesn't have to keep going to other, slower places to get them. Here's how it works:

1. **Speed Matters:** Imagine you're doing a puzzle. You need some puzzle pieces really frequently. Instead of keeping them in a box far away, you put them on a small shelf right next to you. That's your cache - quick and easy to reach.
    
2. **Automatic Decisions:** Your computer decides what to put in the cache. It's like a helper who watches what you're working on and makes sure the pieces you need are always on that small shelf.
    
3. **Space is Limited:** The cache is tiny compared to the other storage places in your computer. It can't hold everything, so it only keeps the most important things.
    
4. **Speed Boost:** Because the cache is super fast to access, it makes your computer work faster. If it didn't have a cache, it would have to go to the bigger, slower places for everything, and that would slow things down.
    
So, the cache is like your computer's super-quick helper that keeps the most important things right at hand, making your computer work more efficiently.
