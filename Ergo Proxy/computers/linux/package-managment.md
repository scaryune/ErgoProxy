## apt
Because Linux is open source, developers can submit software to an *apt* repository. If the software is approved, it then can be accessed by anyone using Linux via the CLI etc.

In `/etc/apt` the files listed with `ls` serve as the gateway/ registry (when on an Ubuntu machine):
```shell
ls
apt.conf.d  auth.conf.d  preferences.d  sources.list  sources.list.d  trusted.gpg.d
```

To see all of the repositories added to your source list:
```shell
cat sources.list
## Note, this file is written by cloud-init on first boot of an instance
## modifications made here will not survive a re-bundle.
## if you wish to make changes you can:
## a.) add 'apt_preserve_sources_list: true' to /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
##     or do the same in user-data
## b.) add sources in /etc/apt/sources.list.d
## c.) make changes to template file /etc/cloud/templates/sources.list.tmpl

### Adding repos:
`add-apt-repository` lets you add provider repos to your `sources.list`. Adding  repos to apt means that whenever we update our system the repos we add *are checked for updates*.
#### Software Integrity:
To help ensure the integrity of software installed, apt uses *GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard) keys*. If the keys of the software do not match the public key provided by the software developers, then the software will not be downloaded.
##### Example with Sublime Text:
1. Download the GPG key for the developers of Sublime Text:
```shell
# from Sublime Text Apr '23:
wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/sublimehq-archive.gpg > /dev/null                                                                    
```
This downloads Sublime's PGP key and adds it to our `trusted.gpg.d` directory.

2. Add Sublime Text's repo to our apt sources list: *it's good practice to have a separate file for every repo you add.*
```shell
cd /etc/appt/sources.list.d
sudo nano sublime-text.list
```
GNU nano:
```nano
deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable
```

3. Update apt so it recognizes the new entry with `apt update`
4. Install the software we have trusted and added to apt with `apt install sublime-text`
### Removing Repos:
You can remove  repos by either using this command:
```shell
add-apt-repository --remove ppa:<PPA_NAME>/ppa
``` 
Or by doing it manually by deleting the file.

Once removed, ask apt to remove the software:
```shell
apt remove [software name]
# sublime text example:
apt remove sublime-text
```
