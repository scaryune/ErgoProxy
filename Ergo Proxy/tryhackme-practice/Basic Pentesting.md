# Scanning

In order to figure out which services are running on the server we've been given, we're going to run [nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpnmap). It's going to be useful to scan with our default safe scripts, so our command will look a little like this:

```
nmap -sV -sC <ip>
```

We might need this information later, so let's make sure we save it somewhere. I like to put all my scans in a single directory in my work folder, so let's `mkdir scans` and then output our nmap scan to a file in that folder:

```
nmap -sV -sC -oN scans/nmap <ip>
```

### Gobuster setup

Visiting the IP we've been given in our browser, we can see that it's running an Apache server, so it's going to be worth looking around to see which folders live on this server. It just so happens we'll need that information for question #3 as well. To find hidden folders, we're going to be running `gobuster`. A simple `dir` scan with `gobuster` should be enough to get the information we need to get going. We're going to be using the `2.3-medium` wordlist from `dirbuster` for this, which should already be on your Kali install.

```
gobuster dir \
-u http://<ip>/ \
-w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt \
-o scans/gobuster
```
