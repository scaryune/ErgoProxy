C++ is a leading programming language used in game development, virtual reality, real-time simulation and high-frequency trading, where efficiency and speed matter.

One reason why C++ is so effective is its ability to work very closely with hardware. Additionally, as an object-oriented programming language, it offers flexibility in development. This makes it the go-to language when speed and performance are non-negotiable.

With a competitive base salary, there is a significant demand for C++ developers in high-stake fields like game development.

If you are simply looking to learn C++ step-by-step, you can follow our free tutorials in the next section.

## Is C++ for you?

Choosing whether to learn C++ depends on your interests in programming and your goals.

### C++ from a Learning Perspective

We will be honest with you, C++ isn't the simplest language to learn. It is more challenging to learn than other programming languages.

Let's see an example.

#### main.cpp

      `#include <iostream>  int main() {      int x = 5, y = 2;     std::cout << x + y;      return 0; }`

      
    

#### main.py

      `x = 5 y = 2 print(x + y)`

      
    

Here, you can see that C++ uses complex syntaxes and concepts just to print the sum of two numbers.

If your goal is to quickly start programming without worrying about the nitty-gritty of how it actually works, then you might consider learning Python.

C++ is ideal if you want to have a solid programming foundation and want to build systems that require high speed and performance because C++ allows you to work closely with hardware and memory.

Yes, C++ is not the easiest programming language to learn. But it is possible. It might take more effort and more dedication, but you won't regret learning it.

### C++ as Career Choice

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that can be used to develop a wide range of applications such as

- Game Development
- Virtual Reality
- Real-time Simulation
- IoT (Internet of Things)
- Browsers, OS, and Databases
- High-Frequencey Trading

Learning C++ offers significant benefits for your career opportunities.

However, C++ may not be the best choice for certain fields where rapid development and simplicity are prioritized. For example, if you are interested in web development, mobile app development, or scripting for automation and data analysis, then C++ might not be the most ideal option.

In these cases, alternatives such as JavaScript for web development, Kotlin, Swift, or Dart for mobile app development, and Python for scripting and data analysis may be more suitable.

Ultimately, your career choices can guide you in selecting which programming language to learn.

## Best Way to Learn C++

There is no right or wrong way to learn C++. It all depends on your learning style and pace.

In this section, we have included the best C++ learning resources tailored to your learning preferences, be it text-based, video-based, or interactive courses.

### Text-based Tutorial

**Best:** if you are committed to learning C++ but do not want to spend on it

If you want to learn C++ for free with a well-organized, step-by-step tutorial, you can use our free [C++ tutorials](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/getting-started).

Our tutorials will guide you through C++ one step at a time, using practical examples to strengthen your foundation.

### Interactive Course

**Best:** if you want hands-on learning, get your progress tracked, and maintain a learning streak

Learning to code is tough. It requires dedication and consistency, and you need to write tons of code yourself.

While videos and tutorials provide you with a step-by-step guide, they lack hands-on experience and structure.

Recognizing all these challenges, Programiz offers a premium [Learn C++ Course](https://programiz.pro/learn/master-cpp) that allows you to gain hands-on learning experience by solving challenges, building real-world projects, and tracking your progress.

There is no easy shortcut to learning coding!

### Online Video

**Best:** if you are an audio-visual learner and learn by watching others code and following along

If you're more of a visual learner, there is a [C++ course by Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y) that will guide you on your journey to C++ programming.

### Mobile App

**Best:** if you are a casual and hobby learner who wants to just get to know C++

While it's possible to learn C++ from mobile apps, it's not the ideal way because writing code can be challenging. Additionally, it's difficult to build real-world projects with multiple files on mobile devices.

Nevertheless, you can use these apps to try things out.

- [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/c-plus-plus-introduction)

**Important:** You cannot learn to code without developing the habit of writing code yourself. Therefore, whatever method you choose, always write code.

While writing code, you will encounter errors. Don't worry about them, try to understand them and find solutions. Remember, programming is all about solving problems, and errors are part of the process.

## How to Run C++?

**1. Run C++ in your browser.**

We have created an [online editor](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/) to run C++ directly in your browser. You don't have to go through a tedious installation process. It's completely free, and you can start coding directly.
