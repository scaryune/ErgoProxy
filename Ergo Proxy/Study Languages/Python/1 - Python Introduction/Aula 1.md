# Getting Started with Python

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language that is widely supported across all major operating systems.

To execute Python code, you need to have a Python interpreter installed on your system. However, if you want to start immediately, you can use our free [online Python editor](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/%3Ca%20href=) that enables you to run Python code directly in your browser—no installation required.

For those who prefer to install Python on your computer, this guide will walk you through the installation process on Windows, macOS, and Linux (Ubuntu).

## Install Python on Windows

To install Python on your Windows, just follow these steps:

1. Install VS Code
2. Download Python Installer File
3. Run the Installer
4. Install Python
5. Verify your installation

Here is a detailed explanation of each of the steps:

### Step 1: Install VS Code

Go to the VS Code [Official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the Windows installer. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the installation process.

Click **Finish** to complete the installation process

### Step 2: Download the Python Installer File

Go to the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version (Python 3.12.2 at the time of writing this tutorial) for Windows.

The website automatically detects your operating system and gives you the right installer.

### Step 3: Run the Installer

Now, go to your **download** folder and run the installer you just downloaded. Depending on your security settings, you might be prompted to allow access.

Simply allow it and proceed.

### Step 4: Install Python

Once you have run the installer, you will come across this screen.

Install Python on Windows

On the screen, you will see two options: **Install Now** and **Customize Installation**. We suggest you skip all customization steps and simply click **Install Now.**

- Check on **Add python.exe to PATH** as it ensures Python is added to our system's PATH variable.(Recommended)
- Click **Install Now**, as it will include all the necessary files needed later.

This makes it easier to run a Python Program from the command prompt (cmd) directly without specifying the full path of the Python executable.

After using this option, Python will be successfully installed in your device.

### Step 4: Verify your installation

After the installation is complete, you can verify whether Python is installed by using the following command in the command prompt.

python --version

**Note:** The version number might differ from the one above, depending on your installed version.

Now, you are all set to run Python programs on your device.

## Run Your First Python Program

First open VS Code, click on the File in the top menu and then select New File.

Create a New File in VS Code

Then, save this file with a .py extension by clicking on **File** again, then **Save As**, and type your filename ending in .py. (Here, we are saving it as Hello_World.py)

Before you start coding, make sure the Python extension is installed in VS Code. Open VS Code and click on Extensions on the left sidebar. Then, search for the **Python** extension by Microsoft and click on install.

Now, write the following code into your file:

`print("Hello World")`

Then click on the **run** button on the top right side of your screen.

![Python Run Program](https://www.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/run-code-in-python-1111.png "Python Run Program")

Python Run Program

You should see Hello World printed to the command prompt.

**Note**: Type python3 in command prompt for macOS and Linux.

Now that you have set everything up to run Python programs on your computer, you'll be learning how the basic program works in Python in the next tutorial.
