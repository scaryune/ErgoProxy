# Your First Python Program

In the previous tutorial, you learned how to [install Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/getting-started) on your computer. Now, let's write a simple Python program.

The following program displays `Hello, World!` on the screen.

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

[Run Code](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler)

**Output**

Hello World!

**Note:** A `Hello World!` program includes the basic syntax of a programming language and helps beginners understand the structure before getting started. That's why it is a common practice to introduce a new language using a `Hello World!` program.

## Working of the Program

Congratulations on writing your first Python program. Now, let's see how the above program works.

Hello World Code

In Python, anything inside `print()` is displayed on the screen.

There are two things to note about `print()`:

- Everything we want to display on the screen is included inside the parentheses `()`.
- The text we want to print is placed within double quotes `" "`.

We can also use single quotes to print text on the screen. For example,

```
print('Hello World!')
```

[Run Code](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler)

is same as

```
print("Hello World!")
```

[Run Code](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler)

To be consistent, we will be using double quotes throughout the tutorials.

Next, we will be learning about [Python comments](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/comments).
