C# (pronounced as C sharp) is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It is one of the most popular languages used for developing desktop and web applications.

Being a C based language, C# is closer to C++ and C. Syntactically, it is similar to Java.

Our C# programming tutorial will guide you to learn C# programming one step at a time.

## About C# Programming

- **Simple** - The code written in C# is much simpler and easier to understand. It is syntactically very similar to Java.
- **Type Safe** - C# ensures that each variable of a particular type does not hold values of other types.
- **Object-oriented** - C# supports the object-oriented paradigm such as objects, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
