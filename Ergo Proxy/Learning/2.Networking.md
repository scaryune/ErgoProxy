Learning how computer networks function and understanding various networking concepts is crucial for ethical hacking. Here's a detailed breakdown of the topics you mentioned:
1. How Networks Function:

Network Basics: Understand that a network is a collection of interconnected devices (nodes) that can communicate with each other. These devices can include computers, servers, routers, switches, and more.

Data Transmission: Learn how data is transmitted over a network. Data is broken into packets, and these packets are sent from the source to the destination. Routers and switches help in routing and forwarding these packets.

IP Addressing: IP addressing is a fundamental concept. An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device on a network. There are two main versions: IPv4 and IPv6. Learn how to format and interpret IP addresses.

Subnetting: Subnetting involves dividing a large IP address space into smaller, more manageable subnetworks. Understand how subnet masks work, and how subnetting is used to optimize network management and security.

Routing: Routers play a vital role in directing network traffic. Learn how routers use routing tables to determine the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination. Study routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, and BGP.

TCP/IP Stack: The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the foundational set of protocols that underpins the internet. Learn about the layers of the TCP/IP stack, including the Application layer, Transport layer, Network layer, and Data Link layer.

2. Common Network Protocols and Services:

DNS (Domain Name System): DNS is responsible for translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses. Learn how DNS works and how attackers might exploit it, such as through DNS spoofing or DNS cache poisoning.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. Understand how HTTP requests and responses work, as well as security concerns like HTTP smuggling, SQL injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP is a protocol for transferring files between systems. Study how FTP operates and its vulnerabilities, including anonymous FTP access and FTP bounce attacks.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): SMTP is used for sending and receiving email. Learn how SMTP functions and security issues related to email, like phishing, spam, and email spoofing.

Other Protocols: Familiarize yourself with additional common network protocols, such as SSH (Secure Shell), Telnet, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), and more. These protocols are important for various aspects of network management and security.

Secure Protocols: Understand the importance of secure versions of these protocols, such as HTTPS (secure HTTP) and SFTP (secure FTP), which encrypt data transmission to protect against eavesdropping and tampering.

To delve deeper into these topics, consider studying specific network-related textbooks or courses, such as the CompTIA Network+ or Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certifications. Hands-on practice in configuring and troubleshooting network components in a lab environment can reinforce your understanding of how networks function and how to secure them. Additionally, there are many online resources, tutorials, and practice labs available to help you gain practical experience in networking and network security.
