When it comes to gaining proficiency in a programming language for ethical hacking, the choice of the "best" language can depend on your specific interests, goals, and the areas of ethical hacking you want to specialize in. However, a few programming languages are widely considered essential for ethical hacking due to their versatility and usefulness in different hacking scenarios:

1. **Python**: Python is often the top recommendation for ethical hackers and cybersecurity professionals. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and a wide range of libraries and frameworks that make it ideal for scripting and automation. Python is well-suited for tasks like creating custom tools, automating penetration testing, and developing exploits. It's also a great choice for web application testing, network analysis, and more. Many popular hacking tools, such as Metasploit, are written in Ruby, but they also have Python APIs. So, Python can be beneficial in many hacking contexts.

2. **C/C++**: While Python is versatile and user-friendly, C and C++ provide a lower-level approach. These languages are useful for developing exploits that require fine-grained control over memory and system resources. Vulnerabilities that lead to buffer overflows and other low-level attacks may require C or C++ for exploitation. Understanding C/C++ is valuable for understanding security vulnerabilities at a deep level.

3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript is vital if you're interested in web application security. Many web applications have client-side code that can be vulnerable to attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). A good grasp of JavaScript can help you identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities.

4. **Bash/Shell scripting**: Proficiency in shell scripting (like Bash on Unix/Linux systems) is essential for automating tasks, analyzing system logs, and managing security configurations on various platforms.

5. **Ruby**: Ruby is commonly used for scripting in the context of Metasploit, a popular penetration testing framework. If you plan to use Metasploit extensively, knowing Ruby can be beneficial.

In many cases, the "best" language is a combination of Python for automation, scripting, and tool development and C/C++ for understanding low-level security issues and creating exploits. Additionally, JavaScript and shell scripting can be essential in their respective domains.

The key is to focus on a language that aligns with your interests and the specific area of ethical hacking you want to specialize in. You don't need to become an expert in all of them, but having a working knowledge of multiple languages can make you a more well-rounded ethical hacker. Also, keep in mind that as technology evolves, the importance of languages may change, so staying adaptable and open to learning new languages is crucial in the field of ethical hacking.
