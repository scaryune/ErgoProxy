# OWASP Amass for [DNS](/networking/DNS/DNS.md) Enumeration:
>	[Official User Guide](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/blob/master/doc/user_guide.md)

Amass is a tool created by [OWASP](cybersecurity/literature/OWASP.md) to do DNS enumeration. It uses both passive and active techniques, including brute forcing (if you tell it to).

You can also create visualizations of the data you get back from a scan, like graphs and maps, using the API and the `viz` subcommand.
## Configuration File:
Configuration can be supplied to amass using either the config file or the `-config` flag (which takes the path to the file and/ or configuration arguments).

Arguments/ parameters given to the amass command *will take precedence over configurations set in the config file*. I.e. if the file has brute-forcing disabled, but the `-brute` flag was supplied, then amass will perform brute force enumeration.
### Location:
The location of the config file can be specified with the `-config` flag or by setting the `AMASS_CONFIG` env variable. The file should be called `config.ini`. This will allow Amass to attempt to find it.
- Linux: `$HOME/.config/amass/config.ini` or `/etc/amass/config.ini`
- Windows: `%AppData%\amass\config.ini`
- Apple: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/amass/config.ini`
#### Output Directory:
The location of the config file is dependent on the *output directory*. Using the `-dir` flag will change the location Amass will use to try and discover the file. For example, if you use `-dir /my/ouput/dir` Amass will go there to look for `config.ini`

## Graph Database:
All findings outputted from an Amass enumeration are stored in a graph database. The graph db is either located in a file in the output directory, or can be connected to remotely using settings in the config file.

If a new enumeration is started and there is already a graph db from a previous enumeration *of the same target*, the new enumeration *will use the subdomain names found during the previous enumeration.*

New DNS queries will also be run on the subdomains to make sure they still are legitimate and have current IP addresses.

Results from each enumeration are stored separately in the db. The `track` subcommand can be used to look for differences between them. 
### Cayley Graph Schema:
The graph db stores all the domains found during an enumeration including associated info like IP, NS Records, CNAME, A Record, IP Block, etc.. Each enumeration has an associated, unique UUID.
#### *BONUS:*
Graphs can also be imported into [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/product-features/).
`amass viz -maltego` <-- converts Amass data to Maltego CSV file.
## Usage:
```bash
Usage: amass intel|enum|viz|track|db [options]

  -h       Show the program usage message
  -help    Show the program usage message
  -version Print the version number of this Amass binary                  
Subcommands: 
        amass intel - Discover targets for enumerations                   
        amass enum  - Perform enumerations and network mapping            
        amass viz   - Visualize enumeration results                       
        amass track - Track differences between enumerations              
        amass db    - Manipulate the Amass graph database
```
### Subcommands:
Amass has a few useful subcommands/ modules which make it very powerful:
#### `intel` Subcommand:
This subcommand will collect *open source* intel on the target org/ domain. It's useful for discovering [root domains](/networking/DNS/DNS.md) associated with the target and for finding *targets for enumeration*.
```bash
amass intel -h
sage: amass intel [options] [-whois -d DOMAIN] [-addr ADDR -asn ASN -cidr CIDR]  
  -active      
        Attempt certificate name grabs                                                                              
  -addr value                    
        IPs and ranges (192.168.1.1-254) separated by commas
  -asn value                      
        ASNs separated by commas (can be used multiple times) 
  -cidr value                      
        CIDRs separated by commas (can be used multiple times)
...
```

Intel will use multiple resources for finding targets including [WHOIS](CLI-tools/whois.md) lookup and IPv4Info. Like the `enum` subcommand, `intel` has an `-active` mode which will allow it to attempt zone transfers(?) and scan to fetch for SSL/TLS certificates in order to extract extra info.

| Flag | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| -active | Enable active recon methods | amass intel -active -addr 192.168.2.1-64 -p 80,443,8080 |

| -cidr | CIDRs separated by commas (can be used multiple times) | amass intel -cidr 104.154.0.0/15 |
| -d | Domain names separated by commas (can be used multiple times) | amass intel -whois -d example.com |

| -v | Output status / debug / troubleshooting info | amass intel -v -whois -d example.com |
| -whois | All discovered domains are run through reverse whois | amass intel -whois -d example.com |
#### `enum` Subcommand:
This subcommand is for performing enumeration and mapping a network. This helps you determine the attack surface of the target and what is exposed.

The findings for this subcommand are *stored in a graph database.* The database lives in the Amass default output folder or a specified output directory (`-dir` flag).

This subcommand can be executed in either a normal, a passive, or an active configuration mode.
##### `-normal`:
Will use data sources to enumerate and will use DNS to *validate findings and investigate the namescpaes in scope* (the domain names given to the command).
`amass enum -d example.com`
##### `-passive`: 
This mode of `enum` is faster, but will not validate the DNS information (like by resolving subdomains).

This can be useful for monitoring a target's attack surface because it will return all subdomains that have been used (*and may be re-used in the future*).
```bash
amass enum -passive -d owasp.org -src
[DNSSpy]          calendar.owasp.org
[AnubisDB]        kerala.owasp.org
[Arquivo]         5c4171004230818351034.owasp.org
[SiteDossier]     owasp4.owasp.org
[Google]          devsecops.owasp.org
[Arquivo]         ads.owasp.org
[AnubisDB]        training.owasp.org
...
```
The `-src` flag tells Amass to include the source of each result in the output (ex: `[DNSSpy]`). The `-d` flag just allows us to list multiple domains separated by a comma.
##### `-active:
The `-active` flag and the active configuration state are different things(?). In this mode, the results are *more accurate* but are obtained using techniques such as *brute forcing*.

The `-active` flag also gathers intel by enabling "zone transfers" and  post scanning of SSL/TLS services. It extracts additional subdomain results by grabbing certificates and scanning for subdomains in their fields.

In the above image amass is enumerating DNS for the target `owasp.org` by brute forcing (`-brute`) with a wordlist (`-w` `/path/to/wordlist`). The output will list the sources (`-src`) and each result's associated [IP address](/networking/OSI/IP-addresses.md) (`-ip`).

The config file amass will use for this command is specified using the `-config /path/to/config.txt` flag, and the output for the results is indicated with the `-o /path/to/output/file.txt` flag.
