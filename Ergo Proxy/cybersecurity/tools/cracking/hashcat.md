# Hashcat
A CLI tool which is able to crack [hashes](cybersecurity/hashing.md) of various algorithms. It works by using techniques like [dictionary attacks](cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/cracking/dictionary-attack.md), [combinator attacks](/cybersecurity/TTPs/cracking/compbinator-attack.md), [brute forcing](/cybersecurity/TTPs/cracking/brute-force.md), etc. against a provided hash.

**hashcat uses your CPU to crack the hash**: so it can take a long time + may be too much work for your hardware depending on your system.
## Example (w/ MD5 hash)
```bash
hashcat -m 0 hashes /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

ATTENTION! Pure (unoptimized) backend kernels selected.
Pure kernels can crack longer passwords, but drastically reduce performance.
If you want to switch to optimized kernels, append -O to your commandline.

## Usage
```bash
hashcat --help
hashcat (v6.2.6) starting in help mode

Usage: hashcat [options]... hash|hashfile|hccapxfile [dictionary|mask|directory]...
```
**NOTE:** Put the hash you want to crack into a file to give to hashcat.
### Example (w/ MD5)
```bash
hashcat -m 0 hashes /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
In this example:
- `-m`: `--hash-type`
- `0`: 0 is the type of algorithm which in this case is MD5
- `hashes`: the file containing *the hash we want to crack*
- `.../rockyou.txt`: the wordlist hashcat should use
