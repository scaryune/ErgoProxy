# Secure/ Multipurpose Internet Mail Exchange
A protocol for digitally signing and encrypting [email](/networking/email.md) which provides the following services:
- #encryption: to protect the content of the email
- #digital-signatures: to verify the identity of the sender of the email

## S/MIME Signatures:
Authentication:
> Signatures validate the identity of the sender. It does so by providing a way to ==differentiate them from others==, thus proving their uniqueness. 

Nonrepudiation:
> Similar to a legally binding document which is signed, #nonrepudiation prevents the owner of a signature from disowning it.

Data Integrity:
> Digital signatures validates to the receiver that the contents of the email were not altered in anyway en route. Any alteration which occurs en route will invalidate the signature.

## S/MIME Encryption:
SMTP does not secure email content (the content can be read along any intercepted part of the emails path to receiving inbox). S/MIME encryption provides:
Confidentiality:
> Protects the content of the email because only the intended recipient can view it. Before leaving the sender's inbox, the content is encrypted to a non-readable format and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.

Data Integrity:
> The algorithm which the content of the email goes through in order to be encrypted helps ensure the data's integrity. Any changing to the contents of the email ==while it is encrypted== will taint the original content and make it unreadable on the receiving side (proving it has lost integrity).
