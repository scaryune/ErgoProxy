# WSTG-CONF-01: Test Network Infra. Configuration
Web server infrastructure can be very complex, so it's important to test the security of its configuration. Testing the configuration management infrastructure should include these steps:
- Determine the elements making up the infrastructure
- Review all the elements for known vulnerabilities
- Review administrative tools
- Review the authentication system
- Maintain a list of the defined ports required for the application

[Mapping the network and application architecture](cybersecurity/literature/WSTG/map-app-architecture.md) should be done first in order to carry out the former list.
