# WSTG-INFO-10:Map Application Architecture
The objective of this step in the WSTG framework is to *understand the architecture* of the applications and services in use. Understanding the infrastructure allows you to effectively test the application.

## Application Components
### Web Server
Applications may run on one, or multiple servers. The server being used can be identified via [WSTG-INFO-02](/cybersecurity/literature/WSTG/fingerprint-web-server.md) (Web Server Fingerprinting)
