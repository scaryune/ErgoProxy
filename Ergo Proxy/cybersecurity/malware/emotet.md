# Emotet Malware
A [trojan]() commonly used as a downloader or dropper of other malware.

## Technical Details:
- primarily spread via #phishing email attachments and links.
	- clicking the link launches the #payload
- The payload proliferates w/i the network by #brute-force ing user credentials and writing to shared drives.
	- Commonly brute forces:
		- password guessing
		- local accounts
		- [SMB](/networking/protocols/SMB.md) Windows Admin Shares
- Difficult to combat due to #worm like features causing network-wide infection
	- Also uses #DLL (Dynamic Link Libraries) to evolve and update its capabilities.

### Characteristics:
- Insertion vector:compromised Windows documents attached to phishing emails
- #C2 network traffic involving #HTTP-POST requests consisting of nonsensical, random length, alphabetical directories to known #emotet related #domains or #IP-addresses 
	- usually w/ the following #user-agent-string 
```
`Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; InfoPath.3; .NET CLR`
```
- common ports for traffic to Emotet-related domains/ IPs:
	- #port-80, #port-8080, #port-443
