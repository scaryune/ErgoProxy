# Web Shells
Web shells are malicious scripts written in web-languages like [PHP](/coding/languages/PHP.md) and [JavaScript](/coding/languages/JS.md) which allows the attacker to *maintain access/ [persistence](/cybersecurity/TTPs/persistence) on a target device.

Web shells normally have a *simplistic file format* w/ extensions that are *difficult to detect* (`.php`, `.asp`, `.jsp`, etc.). This results in them being automatically *classified as benign* by the target.
