# Directory Busting/ Enumeration
Directory busting is a TTP in which the endpoints of a website are enumerated by trying a bunch of different words (usually from a wordlist), appending them to a URL, and attempting to visit them and see what status code/ information they might return.

There are multiple tools which can be used to accomplish this. Some of which do a *recursive search* ([feroxbuster](cybersecurity/tools/scanning-enumeration/feroxbuster.md), [dirb](/cybersecurity/tools/scanning-enumeration/dirb.md)) while others do non-recursive searching ([fuff](/cybersecurity/tools/scanning-enumeration/fuff.md), [gobuster](cybersecurity/tools/scanning-enumeration/gobuster.md)).
