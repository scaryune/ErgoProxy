# Maximum Transmission Unit
The largest size #frame or #packet (in bytes) which can be transmitted across a data-link
- Most often used in reference to packet size across an Ethernet connection using #IP (internet protocol)

### #packet-fragmentation:
ea device in a network has an MTU size it can receive and transmit.
- The MTU of the next receiving device is determined before the packet is sent
	- if the packet is too large, the receiving device cannot accept it so the packet is divided into fragments and sent
	- this is called #packet-fragmentation 
- fragmentation is bad for performance and adds delay and extra data
	- #IPV4 allows for #packet-fragmentation unless the #do-not-fragment-flag is set
	- #IPV6 does *NOT* allow fragmentation
		- if a packet size exceeds its #MTU it will be dropped
