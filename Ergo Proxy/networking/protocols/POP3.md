# Post Office Protocol
An email protocol which is responsible for transferring emails b/w a #mail-server and client.

## Process:
- Emails downloaded and stored on a single device
	- Sent messages are stored on the device from which they were sent
	- Emails can only be accessed from the device they were sent/ downloaded to
- If you want them to be kept on the server `keep email on the server` option has to be selected
	- otherwise the messages are deleted from the server once they're downloaded
