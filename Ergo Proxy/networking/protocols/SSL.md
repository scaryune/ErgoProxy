# SSL: Secure Socket Layer
SSL is a protocol used w/ [HTTPS](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes/tree/main/networking/protocols/HTTPS.md) to encrypt and ensure the authenticity and privacy of data sent over the web. *SSL is the predecessor of [TLS](/networking/protocols/TLS.md)* but is still widely used.

Website which use SSL have `https` in their URL rather than [`http`](/networking/protocols/HTTP.md).
