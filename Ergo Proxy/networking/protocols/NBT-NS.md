# NetBIOS Name Service
A Windows protocol used to translate #NetBIOS names to [IP Addresses](networking/OSI/IP-addresses.md) on a local network. Is the predecessor to [LLMNR](/networking/protocols/LLMNR.md).

## Mechanism:
Each machine on the network is assigned a #NetBIOS-name by the NBT-NS service. 

Uses [UDP](networking/protocols/UDP.md) #port-137.
