# File Transfer Protocol
A client-server protocol used to communicate and transfer files using [[TCP]] between computers on a network. Users who wish to use an FTP connection need to have permission which is gained by providing credentials to the server.

Some *public* FTP servers *don't require credentials* which is called and allow users to login via the `anonymous` user. This is called *anonymous FTP*.
## Channels
There are two distinct channels:
### Command Channel:
FTP connection initiates the instruction and response.
### Data Channel:
where distribution of data happens b/w peers.
## Anonymous FTP
Sites can enable anonymous FTP so files are available to the public. Users can access the files w/o a password and with the username ``anonymous``. *Access is limited to copying files* and anonymous ftp *does not allow the user to navigate through directories*.
## Secure FTP or SSH FTP
This is an extension of [SSH](/networking/protocols/SSH.md).
