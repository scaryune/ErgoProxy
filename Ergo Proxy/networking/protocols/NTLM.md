# Windows New Technology LAN Manager
A suite of protocols from Microsoft used to authenticate users and make their activity confidential. It uses a *challenge-response* mechanism where the client has to prove to the server that it knows the password associated w/ a username *w/o passing the password over the network*.
## Challenge-Response Mechanism:

### Three messages:
#### Negotiation:
Client machine sends request to a server with the username and other configuration information.
#### Challenge:
The server responds by sending the client a randomly generated number.
#### Authenticate:
To prove that it knows the password, the client encrypts the random number using the DES algorithm and the NT-hash of the user password as a key.

The server then verifies the user's identity by making sure that the *challenge* was created w/ the correct username and password. 
- It will either use the stored NT-hash from its own database or it will forward the challenge/response pair to the domain-controller for validation.
## Security:
NTLM is vulnerable to a few different attack vectors:
![Pass the Hash](cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/pass-the-hash.md)
### Brute Force Attack:
NTLM is vulnerable to brute-force attacks b/c the hashing algorithm (DES) does not use a salt.
- A salt adds random characters to a password before it's hashed, making it more difficult to de-obfuscate.
	-  Salting example:
		1. xxxxxxxxx (password)
		2. sha256([salt]password[pepper])

B/c there is no salting of the hashed passwords an attacker can use a [rainbow table](cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/rainbow-table.md) to brute force the hash using pre-calculated hashes of standard passwords. This method is *less effective* on passwords which are more complex and longer (> 15 characters).
### NTLM Relay Attack
Since the user's client has no way or verifying the identity of the server, an attacker can perform a [Man in the Middle (MITM)](cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/MITM.md) by pretending to be the server to the client, and the client to the server.

### Other Vulnerabilities:
#### NTLM *does not support MFA*:
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) would be a strong defense against NTLM attacks since adding a second authentication step would make it harder for an attacker to authenticate w/ just the password hash. Unfortunately, NTLM doesn't support MFA.
#### Letter casing:
During the hashing of a password, all lower case letters are converted to uppercase, so the time-complexity associated w/ cracking the hash is limited. It only takes 2.5 hours to crack an 8-character password (see links).
#### The challenge:
The challenge is only a 16-byte random number which is actually not that random (NTLMv1).
#### Uses MD4:
Not NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 use the MD4 hashing algorithm which is *considered obsolete*.
