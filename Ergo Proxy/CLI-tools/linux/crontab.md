### Setup Crontab for a user:
Crontab is *user specific*. You can check if a user already has a crontab by using the `-l` switch. To create a crontab for a user, use `crontab -e`. This will open a text editor of your choice.

In the text editor, paste a cron job. Now this cron job will run for the user.
