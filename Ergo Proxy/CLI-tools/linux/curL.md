### Useful options:
#### `curl -I` Headers only:
**HTTP/S, FTP & FILE:** This flag will tell `curl` to only retrieve and return the headers from the response. This is useful *specifically for pentesting/ cybersecurity* because less data is transferred in the target server's response.
#### `curl -L` Follow all re-directs:
**HTTP:** if the server responds with a `3xx` response code (the webpage has been moved), `curl` will follow all redirects by redoing the request using the new URL. The data returned will be from the new location the redirect points to. 
#### `curl -H "header: string"` Setting custom headers:
**HTTP, IMAP, & SMTP:** The `-H` flag will allow you to set custom headers *in addition to the ones sent by default* (however, if you set a header which happens to match one of the defaults, your value will be sent instead of the default's).
#### `curl -X` Setting the request method
**HTTP only:** With the `-X` flag you can set the [request method](www/HTTP-request.md) type ()
