# Nmap: Network Mapper
```
nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] {target sppecification}
```
## Usage:
### Host Discovery:
#### `-Pn` No Ping
This tells nmap to *skip host discovery*. Setting `-Pn` will tell nmap to attempt the additional flags/ scanning functions *against every IP address specified*.
#### `-PA` & `-PS` TCP ACK & TCP SYN
The `-PS` flag tells nmap to send a *TCP SYN* packet to the specified ports. When the host responds (w/ TCP ACK), the *kernel of the scanning machine* sends a TCP RST packet. If no ports are specified, nmap will scan the defaults (80). *There should be no space between `-PS` and the ports*:
```bash
nmap -PA1-1000 $t
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at...
```
The `-PS` flag is similar to `-PA` but instead of sending an SYN packet, nmap *sends an ACK* packet. The reason for sending different packet types *is to test for [firewalls](cybersecurity/defense/firewalls.md)*.
### `-sT` TCP scan:
TCP connect scan scans for [TCP](/networking/protocols/TCP.md) ports and performs the *entire three way handshake* with the target system. nmap reports the port status depending on the flags it exchanges with the target.
#### Results:
If nmap receives an `ACK` flag, it reports the port as _open_. If it receives the `RST` flag, it reports the port as *closed*.

If there is no response, that likely means *the port is hidden behind a firewall.* This is because older [firewalls](/cybersecurity/defense/firewalls.md) will drop the packet. *Some firewalls are configured to send a fabricated `RST` flag* which nmap will mark as "closed."
### `-sS` (half/open or "stealth"):
SYN connect scan/ "half-open" or "stealth" scan. When the target sends the `SYN/ACK` flag, nmap (the client) then sends the `RST` flag which closes the connection. This prevents the target from repeatedly sending requests.
#### Advantages:
- This is *the default scan* run by nmap when executed with `sudo`. It's considered "stealthy" because most *older* IDS systems only log a connection if it was fully-established (i.e. the entire three-way handshake was performed).
- This scan is also *faster than the TCP*.
#### Disadvantages:
- May not work with *newer IDS's* which track/log all connection requests whether or not they completed.
- May cause unstable target OSes to *crash*.
- Requires *sudo privileges*.
### `-sV` (versioning):
When **NOT** given this flag, nmap will scan a target and list the services which are *likely* to be hosted at specific ports. For example, most systems will host their [SMTP](/networking/protocols/SMTP.md) [email](/networking/email.md) service on port 25. If nmap finds that port is open, it will report that the service running on the target is SMTP on port 25.

Nmap uses their nmap-services database of about 2200 known, common ports and their services to do this. *However* any port can theoretically host *any service*.

To more accurately determine the service hosted on a target port, the `-sV` flag can be given. This enables version detection.
#### Version detection mode:
When `-sV` is given and a scan is performed in version detection mode, nmap will attempt to determine the service by *querying each open port* using probes from their database.

*If nmap cannot match port responses* to their database, it will print a fingerprint to the command line which you can submit to nmap (via a URL printed with the fingerprint).

```bash
nmap -sV -sT -Pn 10.0.2.4

Service Info: OSs: Windows, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows, cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 28.42 seconds
```
#### Versioning Options:
##### `--all-ports`:
Every port scanned will be submitted to version detection (querying for a response from the service).
##### `--version-intensity <intensity>`:
The probes sent by nmap for versioning are assigned a rarity value b/w 1 and 9. Lower numbers *have had the most success against targets in the past*. Higher numbers are more accurate but take longer.

The default is set to 7. 
##### `--version-all`
Try *every single probe*.
### `-O` OS Detection:
This flag enables nmap to do *OS detection* on the target. It requires *sudo* privileges.

Nmap does OS detection by using [TCP/IP](/networking/protocols/TCP.md) stack fingerprinting. Basically, it sends TCP and [UDP](/networking/protocols/UDP.md) packets to the remote target and examines every single bit in the responses.

After performing a number of tests on the responses (including TCP ISN sampling, checking the window size, IP ID sampling, etc) it will compare the results to nmap's *OS database* of >2600 known OS fingerprints.
#### Result reliability:
If the results of the scan include *both an open and closed port* than the OS detection results can be considered "good". However, if not, then nmap reports the results as "unreliable".

When nmap can't detect a perfect match, then it will perform *aggressive OS detection* and offer up near-possibilities w/ % of likelihood:
```bash
... 
2222/tcp open  EtherNetIP-1
MAC Address: 52:54:00:12:35:04 (QEMU virtual NIC)
Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port
Device type: general purpose|bridge|switch|printer
Running (JUST GUESSING): QEMU (96%), Oracle Virtualbox (95%), Bay Networks embedded (88%), Samsung embedded (87%), Dell embedded (87%), Wind River VxWorks (87%), Xerox embedded (86%)
OS CPE: cpe:/a:qemu:qemu cpe:/o:oracle:virtualbox cpe:/h:baynetworks:baystack_450 cpe:/h:samsung:clp-315w cpe:/h:dell:1815dn cpe:/o:windriver:vxworks cpe:/h:xerox:workcentre_4150
Aggressive OS guesses: QEMU user mode network gateway (96%), Oracle Virtualbox (95%), Bay Networks BayStack 450 switch (software version 3.1.0.22) (88%), Samsung CLP-315W printer (87%), Dell 1815dn printer (87%), VxWorks (87%), Xerox WorkCentre 4150 printer (86%)
No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).
Network Distance: 1 hop
```

If you don't want nmap to do OS detection unless it will be reliable (at least one open and one closed port), you can add the `--osscan-limit`. With this flag, OS detection will not be performed unless there is at least one open and one closed port.
#### Other useful info:
The `-O` scan also returns info that is useful about the target beyond the OS including:
- MAC address
- Device type
- CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)
- Network distance (how many hops)
### `-sU` UDP/ "stateless":
Since UDP doesn't require a handshake, it's considered "stateless". When there is no response to a packet sent by nmap to the port, it is more difficult for nmap to determine the state of the port.

Scanning for ports using the UDP protocol *takes longer* which means that *some security auditors will ignore UDP ports*. These include common, important which host services like [DNS](/networking/DNS/DNS.md), [SNMP](/networking/protocols/SNMP.md), [DHCP](/networking/protocols/DHCP.md), etc..

Nmap attempts to detect UDP ports by sending a UDP packet *without a payload* to every target port. It will report the results based on the response:

|Probe Response|Assigned State|
|---|---|
|Any UDP response from target port (unusual)|`open`|
|No response received (even after retransmissions)|`open\|filtered`|
|ICMP port unreachable error (type 3, code 3)|`closed`|
|Other ICMP unreachable errors (type 3, code 1, 2, 9, 10, or 13)|`filtered`|
>	[Nmap.org](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-udp-scan.html)
#### Speeding up UDP scans:

```
>	command from [Nmap.org](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-udp-scan.html)

- Set version detection to `0` if doing version scanning
- If possible *scan after bypassing the firewall* (from behind the firewall)
- Use `--host-timeout` to skip 'slow' hosts (some are ICMP rate limited) (ex: `--host-timeout 5m` = 5 minutes)
- Use `-v` (verbosity): this flag will tell you real time how long nmap thinks the scan will take
- Limit the number of ports scanned: `-p <number or range>`
### TCP FIN, NULL, & Xmas Scans:
These scans send *malformed packets* which allows them to be stealthier in some contexts. This is because *most* firewalls automatically block incoming requests w/ the `SYN` flag but *don't block packets w/o the `SYN` flag*.

According to [Nmap.org](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-null-fin-xmas-scan.html):
>	"Page 65 of RFC 793 says that “if the [destination] port state is CLOSED .... an incoming segment not containing a RST causes a RST to be sent in response.” Then the next page discusses packets sent to open ports without the SYN, RST, or ACK bits set, stating that: “you are unlikely to get here, but if you do, drop the segment, and return.”

Closed ports will respond to all of these scans with an `RST` flag:

|Probe Response|Assigned State|
|---|---|
|No response received (even after retransmissions)|`open\|filtered`|
|TCP RST packet|`closed`|
|ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13)|`filtered`|
> 	Nmap.org
#### `-sN` NULL scan:
This scan sends a TCP packet *without any flags set* so the packet is empty (TCP header is 0).
#### `-sF` TCP Fin:
The only bit set in the packet is the `TCP FIN` bit.
#### `-sX` Xmas scan:
Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags which "lights the packet up like a xmas tree"
### [Nmap Scripting Engine](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html):
Nmap comes with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) which is a collection of user-written [Lua](/coding/languages/lua.md) scripts used to automate a wide-variety of networking tasks.
```bash
sudo nmap -sSUC -p 111 10.0.3.5

```
In this example, the `-sS` (TCP Syn scan), `-sU` (UDP), and `-sC` (scripting) flags are given with a target port of `111` (usually [RPC](/networking/protocols/RPC.md)). With these flags, nmap is able to return *extra* information as it relates to `port 111` on the target.

Nmap ran default script/s written specifically for port 111. In this case, the script was able to enumerate specific programs, including their numbers, version, and service.

The same scan, on the same target *without the `-sC` flag* returns the following, less-detailed report:
```bash
sudo nmap -sSU -p 111 10.0.3.5

111/udp open  rpcbind
MAC Address: x:x:x:x:x:x (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.40 seconds
```
#### `-sC` Scripting:
To use the NSE, the `-sC` flag is provided. You can either use it without any arguments (and default scripts will be ran based on the rest of the `nmap` command), or you can give `-sC` the path to a custom script you want run.
