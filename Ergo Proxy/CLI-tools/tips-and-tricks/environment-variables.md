# x68 on $SHELL
my first targets on a machine: `~/.${SHELL}rc`, `~/.${SHELL}_profile`, `~/.${SHELL}_logout`, `~/.${SHELL}_history`, `~/.ssh` and `~/.aws` and a such. I really love IDE scratch files as well.

`~/.bashrc` for example, if `$SHELL` is bash, `~/.bashrc` is gonna tell you about the user environment. Code monkeys often will hard code secrets in there

`~/.aws` and `~/.ssh` are good for secrets to connect to other systems
